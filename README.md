# Art Relief Map

The Art Relief Map is an online record of therapeutic art-based offerings that emerged organically in Western North Carolina, USA in the wake of the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene in late September, 2024. The map visually depicts a topography of healing, providing geographic locations of art-based programming and sharing stories of program development from facilitators' perspectives. Artifacts (art products and images) as well as artistic reflections by facilitators are also provided.
