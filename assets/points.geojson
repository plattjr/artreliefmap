        "narrative": "An excerpt from my journal: Oct.3,2024 \nToday I was scheduled to put up my show \"Intraconnection\" at the Jones House Gallery. That is no longer going to happen. Instead, I took what energy I had to offer and set up a table in front of Anna Banana's on the corner of King and Depot streets smack dab in the middle of downtown.   I want to hold space for my community and offer them a place to create and express themselves, a place to take a breath and press PAUSE and to offer words of encouragement and nourishment to each other. I am calling it  Sidewalk Expressive Arts Ministry. I am christening myself an Expressive Arts Minister today. I made that up or should I say it dropped down and I caught it. This work gave me purpose. A table with leather heart necklaces, string, scissors, cray pas, markers, crayons, paint pens, chalks, paper hearts and stacks of colored cardstock became my offering. Locals came by, volunteers stopped, families, individuals, children, adults, college kids---everyone was curious and most decided to engage in the activity. Children were quick to drop into the creative flow and process. We have so much to learn from them. Others drew pictures, wrote words of encouragement, cried, hugged each other and lingered in the space reading all of outpouring the walls gathered. One child apologized to Mother Earth for all of us. I knew this was the right decision and hope to continue this offering for a solid week.",

        "account": "On the first day that I had the table out, a babysitter and two children came by to create their response to Hurricane Helene. This brother and sister took the assignment seriously. The little boy drew a picture and I asked him to tell me about it. He said, \"It is rain.\" Then he grabbed another piece of paper and drew another image. Again, I asked \" tell me about this one\" and he replied \" it is rain and mud.\" As he continued the work at hand,  he offered these words \"rain, mud, and my house\"  to describe the next image in the series. To end his story, he drew his house and a rainbow. At this point, he wanted me to create a book and attach his picture in a narrative form as his contribution to the wall. Using the supplies we had on hand, we hole punched the corner of the four pieces and strung yarn through them. He chose where to attach it to the wall. Having a child work through his trauma on the street corner just by offering the mere invitation to create felt incredibly powerful to me and solidified my commitment to providing this opportunity to my community.",

        "narrative": "Hurricane Helene and Expressive Arts In The South Toe Valley\n\nThe South Toe Valley beneath Mt. Mitchell was devastated by Hurricane Helene. Roads, bridges and houses were washed away not only by the South Toe River but by the many creeks that became rivers. Mudslides destroyed roads and for a short time, the valley was entirely cut off. It wasn‚Äôt long before people with heavy machinery began clearing the roads and fixing some of the bridges. The Celo Community land trust became one of the information hubs in the valley, and although not a member myself, as a close neighbor I am very familiar with the land and people who do live there. It was in this setting that a number of educators gathered together under the guidance of Jeff Goodman, a recently retired educator at Appalachian State University,  and a community school was created. We began a week after the hurricane blew through the valley and provided this service for two weeks every week day morning for approximately 30 children.\n\nWe met outside around a campfire almost every morning. Sitting around the fire gave everyone a chance to slowly awaken and become present with themselves and each other.. We always started the day singing songs and doing a variety of movement games and activities. ‚ÄúGive Take Shake Shake Shake‚Äù was a favorite, as were some of the old classics such as ‚ÄúHokey Pokey,‚Äù ‚ÄúHead, Shoulders, Knees and Toes,‚Äù and ‚ÄúHere We Go Round the Mulberry Bush.‚Äù The ages of the children ranged from 5-17 years old. Perhaps the presence of the younger children encouraged the older ones to enter into the spirit of the singing and movement. We then split the children and teens into three groups. Most days the groups were: K-2nd grade, 3rd-6th grade, and 7th grade and up.\n\nOn the first day of this informal community school the adults agreed that using a variety of expressive arts would be a good way to help the teens capture what had just happened. The first invitation was to write 2-3 things they remembered from the first few days post-hurricane using all their senses as a starting point: I saw... I heard... I smelled... I touched/felt... I tasted... They then shared what they had written with a partner. After this sharing they were invited to share one or two of their sense memories with the whole group of which there were approximately 10 students aged between 12 and 17. Here is a selection.\n\nThings That Were Seen\nAn apple from my apple tree half a mile down the creek\nHalf the road washed away\nWhen they fixed the bridge by just filling it in with rock, I was so appreciative of everyone Coming together to help\nTrees falling down\nVolunteers working\nBridges and sheds and cars smashed\nPeople crying about the storm\nIncredibly vivid stars/shooting stars\n\nThings That Were Heard\nHelicopters flying over our house\nDuring the flood I heard huge boulders and trees knocking into each other. It was jarring.\nThe complete quiet when the power went out\nBulldozers beeping\nWater gushing everywhere\nA lot of people asking if we are ok and what we need\nLots of helicopters\n\nThings That Were Smelled\nA dead turkey\nMud\nThe smell of a dry sunny day after the flood\nThe smell of the potluck the day after the flood. It made me happy to gather.\nGasoline\nPropane from our neighbors house\nLavender to help me fall asleep\nMusty wet and muddy houses\n\nThings That Were Touched/Felt\nThe day of the flood walking home barefoot in the fine silt\nSoggy belongings clearing out of peoples‚Äô houses\nScared, hopeful, sad.\nAnnoyed by all the destruction\nSad for all the people who lost their houses\nMud covered wet books almost falling apart in my hands\n\nThings That Were Tasted\nNutter butter a helicopter dropped\nTea\nApple sauce\nThe comfort food of veggie straws and sticky old Halloween candy\n\nWe ended that first morning by covering the large outdoor table that we were sitting at with paper so that the group could doodle and draw with a variety of materials, which included craypas, markers, and pencils. Some used it as a way to express ideas and emotions related to the flood. For example there was a dramatic ‚Äúbefore and after‚Äù picture. Others used it as a way to distract themselves and/or regulate themselves from the flood by playing tic tac toe and doodling their favorite patterns and pictures.\n\nOn the next day that we met, the students were invited to share sense memories that they thought the river might have had. I saw curiosity and interest on many faces. Shifting perspective like this was something I was used to doing as a student in the expressive arts program at Appalachian State University, but this was a new idea for the students. They worked together in small groups and wrote down all their ideas. After spending some time doing this they all came back together and each group was invited to share a line or two. These lines were collected on a large piece of paper with the title: The River‚Äôs Experience\n\nI swept away houses\nI carved away roads\nI felt the rearranging of my bed and banks\nI smelled propane from the tanks I broke open\nI heard trees falling into me\nI felt anger\nI saw a road\nI tasted a road\nI jumped my banks\nI tasted silt and sand\n\nWith permission, a community member who is a poet photographed the paper with each group's contributions on it and posted it in the community glass fronted poetry box that hosts a weekly poem for anyone who wants to read it.\n\nThese were some of the lines generated in the small groups that didn‚Äôt make it into the community poem.\nI swallowed a tree\nI twirled a stick\nI split a salamander\nI felt a boulder hit my bed\nI slammed houses off their foundations\nI lapped at the bottom of hills\nI pulled boulders from their place in the bank\nI was angry I exploded\nI felt my full power come unleashed\nI rushed, I ran, I swept\nI was bigger and wider than ever\nI dug deeper than ever\nI smelled houses, propane, flesh, trees.\n\nWe gathered each morning for 2 weeks, around a campfire, with singing and movement all together before splitting into groups for a variety of learning activities. This pop up community school brought students together from a wide range of schools and with a wide range of ages, experiences, and abilities. It also brought many talented educators together from a diversity of schools. In the aftermath of this disaster, something very special was created that will stay alive in my memory forever.",
        "outcomes": "1. Opportunities to build a sense of togetherness, support and belonging.\n2. Opportunities for co-regulation with peers and for everyone to learn from each other. All ages and abilities were welcome.\n3. Opportunities to: feel embodied, recover self-efficacy, restore playfulness, rescript dominant narratives and let the senses tell the story.",
        "account": "Hearing each persons own sense memories on the first day was very powerful. Each person shared one or two they felt comfortable sharing with the group and there were lots of times when someone's memory sparked a moment of connection with another person. They recognized something in the shared memory that resonated with their own experiences. There was a feeling of being understood at a deep level during a time of unfathomable destruction.\n\nCreating a \"found\" poem from each group's \"River's Experience\" work felt meaningful. I don't know what happened for each teen who took part, but for me it was a chance to understand the river and see things from its perspective. This river was a beautiful clean river that had many wonderful swimming holes used copiously all summer long. It has changed so much and so much around it has been destroyed. I raised my two boys on its banks each summer for many years. It felt like a second mother keeping them entertained for many hours at a time. It's makes me think about how I can give back to the river. How can I be a part of restoring its unique ecosystem?",
        "process": "I have been working with a sand tray and various river rocks, stones, glass and crystals for a while now. These materials allow a creation to live in the box for awhile before being dismantled so that something new can be made. Creating a \"river\" out of river and ocean brushed glass, rocks and crystals came quite naturally out of this process. I had noticed too that much of the damage had occurred on the outside of the curve in the river, whereas the inside of a curve often survived with less damage. This emphasis was represented by the build up of stones on the outside of the curves. \n\nAnother thing that happened in real life were new banks of stone and sand deposits in places where there had been much less or none before the flood. Places that had been considered \"beaches\" or sandy entrance points into the river were no longer there and new places had been created. The stone and rock deposits are also echoed in the sand tray with the build up of rocks in certain places.",
        "press": "There was a Sierra Club article written about the Celo Community and part of it featured this \"community school.‚Äù I was not asked by the author if lines from the group poem could be used. I assume they simply took them from the copy that was posted in the community poetry box, which was open to the public. (Permission to post it there was given by me to a community member and friend who is a poet.) Similarly, although I had allowed photos to be taken by the other educators and had verbally said they could be used by them, I had not been asked by the author of the Sierra Club article if the photo that I was in could be used.",
