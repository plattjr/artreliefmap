        "narrative": "The Sidewalk Expressive Arts Ministry was located in the heart of downtown Boone, NC, an area that suffered catastrophic flooding and also served the wider displaced population. I established the outdoor street ministry in front of a consignment shop that had opened a free clothing store. At the time of the offering, downtown Boone was alive with first responders, community members, local business owners, National Guard personnel, evacuees, volunteers, and families with children. An excerpt from my journal, October 3, 2024: “Today I was scheduled to put up my show ‘Intraconnection’ at the Jones House Gallery. That is no longer going to happen. Instead, I took what energy I had to offer and set up a table on the corner of King and Depot streets smack dab in the middle of downtown. I want to hold space for my community and offer them a place to create and express themselves, a place to take a breath and press PAUSE and to offer words of encouragement and nourishment to each other. I am calling it the Sidewalk Expressive Arts Ministry. I am christening myself an Expressive Arts Minister today. I made that up or should I say it dropped down and I caught it. This work gave me purpose. A table with leather heart necklaces, string, scissors, cray pas, markers, crayons, paint pens, chalks, paper hearts, and stacks of colored cardstock became my offering. Locals came by, volunteers stopped, families, individuals, children, adults, college kids---everyone was curious and most decided to engage in the activity. Children were quick to drop into the creative flow and process. We have so much to learn from them. Others drew pictures, wrote words of encouragement, cried, hugged each other and lingered in the space reading all of the outpouring the walls gathered. One child apologized to Mother Earth for all of us.” On the first day, a little boy drew a picture and I asked him to tell me about it. He said, \"It is rain.\" Then he drew another image. Again, I asked \" tell me about this one\" and he replied \"it is rain and mud.\" He offered the words \"rain, mud, and my house\" to describe the following image in the series. To end his story, he drew his house and a rainbow. Using the supplies on hand, we created a book of his images, and he chose where to attach it to our community art wall. A close up photograph of a portion of the community art wall is displayed below.",

        "narrative": "The South Toe Valley beneath Mt. Mitchell was devastated by Hurricane Helene. The Celo Community Land Trust became one of the information hubs in the valley, and it was in this setting that a number of educators gathered together, and a community school was created. We began a week after the hurricane and served approximately 30 children from 5-17 years of age for two weeks every weekday morning. We met around a campfire most mornings, starting the day with singing and a variety of movement games and activities. After singing, three groups were formed: K-2nd grade, 3rd-6th grade, and 7th grade and up. I worked with the older students, and the first invitation was to write 2-3 things they remembered from the first few days post-hurricane using all their senses as a starting point: “I saw... I heard... I smelled... I touched/felt... I tasted…” These memories were shared verbally with a partner first, then students were invited to share aloud one or two of their sense memories with the whole group of approximately 10 students. We ended the morning by covering a large outdoor table with paper to doodle and draw with craypas, markers, and pencils. Some expressed ideas and emotions related to the flood. For example, there was an energetic “before and after” picture. Others distracted and/or regulated themselves by playing tic tac toe and doodling favorite patterns and pictures. The next day, the students were invited to share sense memories from the river’s perspective. Before the flood, the South Toe River had been beloved by many for its clean, swimmable water and many beautiful spots along its banks. Now it was the cause of so much destruction. I saw curiosity and interest on many faces. Shifting perspective like this was a new idea for the students. In small groups, they wrote down their ideas. Each group was invited to share a line or two. These were collected on a large piece of paper, with the title, ‘The River’s Experience.’",
        "outcomes": "togetherness, support and belonging, co-regulation, embodiment, self-efficacy, playfulness, rescripting narratives, and letting the senses tell the story.",
        "account": "Hearing each persons own sense memories on the first day was very powerful. Each person shared one or two they felt comfortable sharing with the group and there were lots of times when someone's memory sparked a moment of connection with another person. They recognized something in the shared memory that resonated with their own experiences. There was a feeling of being understood at a deep level during a time of unfathomable destruction.\n\nCreating a \"found\" poem from each group's \"River's Experience\" work felt meaningful. I don't know what happened for each teen who took part, but for me it was a chance to understand the river and see things from its perspective. This river was a beautiful clean river that had many wonderful swimming holes used copiously all summer long. It has changed so much and so much around it has been destroyed. I raised my two boys on its banks each summer for many years. It felt like a second mother keeping them entertained for many hours at a time. It's makes me think about how I can give back to the river. How can I be a part of restoring its unique ecosystem?",
        "process": "I have been working with a sand tray and various river rocks, stones, glass and crystals for a while now. These materials allow a creation to live in the box for awhile before being dismantled so that something new can be made. Creating a \"river\" out of river and ocean brushed glass, rocks and crystals came quite naturally out of this process. I had noticed too that much of the damage had occurred on the outside of the curve in the river, whereas the inside of a curve often survived with less damage. This emphasis was represented by the build up of stones on the outside of the curves. \n\nAnother thing that happened in real life were new banks of stone and sand deposits in places where there had been much less or none before the flood. Places that had been considered \"beaches\" or sandy entrance points into the river were no longer there and new places had been created. The stone and rock deposits are also echoed in the sand tray with the build up of rocks in certain places.",
        "press": "There was a Sierra Club article written about the Celo Community and part of it featured this \"community school.‚Äù I was not asked by the author if lines from the group poem could be used. I assume they simply took them from the copy that was posted in the community poetry box, which was open to the public. (Permission to post it there was given by me to a community member and friend who is a poet.) Similarly, although I had allowed photos to be taken by the other educators and had verbally said they could be used by them, I had not been asked by the author of the Sierra Club article if the photo that I was in could be used.",

        "narrative": "Tucked away, hidden behind Old US 70 in Swannanoa is the Grovemont Community. At the heart of this community is a park, public library, and pulsing current of resiliency. On Sunday, September 29th, two days after the rain had stopped, a distribution center was already established in the park. Local community organizers asked my friend and I what we could offer.  In response, we co-created the Regulation Station. Both social workers with experience working with kids, we used materials on hand at the library to emphasize the healing aspects of Expressive Arts, play, and togetherness. The Regulation Station lived under the protection of trees, offering cool shade in the hot, sunny days following Helene. We adorned benches with invitations for expression, the senses serving as the muse. There were materials for collaging, flower crowns, and friendship bracelets. There were benches with sports equipment, games, musical instruments, playdough, sand trays, bubbles, and toys. We lined a picnic table with rolls of paper for slime and paint and cut discarded cardboard into different sized canvases.Adults and kids alike took refuge under the trees, engaging with the materials and experiencing moments of reciprocity and laughter, contentment and community. Inanimate rocks came to life through acrylic creativity; popsicle sticks were given names as they transformed into figurines through googly eyes and pipe cleaners. There was no right or wrong way to engage; here the body could shift from storing collective trauma to the action agent for healing. Experiences began to be processed through social stories emerging from play. A two-and-a-half year old boy dumped all the hot wheel cars out on the ground and lined them up on a bench, where the cars crashed into one another and response vehicles came to the rescue. When his mom and I wondered about this together, she told me their story of evacuation and a massive accident on the highway. “Ah,” I said to the little boy, “you are remembering the accident you saw on the highway.” The little boy looked at me with clarity and smiled. His mother embraced him, and he leaned in. “It was really scary,” she said, “but we were safe.” A sense of autonomy could be felt through the creative process. A young girl of about six years of age approached the painting station with enthusiasm. She painted a scene that included a cherry blossom tree, rain, and a figure sitting under the tree reading a book. She explained, “that’s a cherry blossom tree, they’re my favorite. That’s me sitting under the cherry blossom, the cherry blossom keeps the people safe from the rain, and the rain helps the cherry blossom tree grow bigger so more people can fit under it.” Her four-year old brother painted a boat floating on a river and explained that the boat kept everyone safe, and the river helped them escape the “broken house.” Their mother colored next to them, calmly telling me how they lost everything but were lucky because they had each other and extended family who lived close. An image from a collective art display within Regulation Station, is provided below.",

        "narrative": "A week after Hurricane Helene, I began volunteering at a Red Cross Shelter in Ashe County High School. The shelter housed about ten residents who were displaced from their homes and missing pets who were staying with neighbors or lost to violent flood waters. With schools closed for the foreseeable future, my own displacement came in the form of an abrupt halt to my work as a middle school mental health therapist. I offered services to my existing clients, but everyone flatly responded that there must be families in greater need of support. My teenage clients sounded bored and confused; many were shuffling between homes depending on who had power and water. It felt like the Covid quarantine. I was concerned about the mental health of these teenagers who once again had no reason to brush their teeth or get dressed in the morning. I told my colleague that I was spending my days at the Red Cross Shelter, and we decided to bring Expressive Arts there for the residents and students of the county to come and create. I wanted to remind these young people who had experienced long school closures during the pandemic that, while we were living through a trauma, we didn’t have to do so in isolation. We hosted the Expressive Arts experience for four days in the high school cafeteria, with participants ranging from 4 to 14 years old. Red Cross volunteers set out snacks and pulled out donations they thought the children may want to take home. As the children shyly trickled in on the first day, my colleague and I set up stations with supplies for stick wrapping, collage, and a range of other materials. The gratitude and relief was clear on the adults’ faces as they signed their children in; they needed a quiet moment to process. On the second day, we walked around campus collecting natural materials to paint on or wrap with yarn. One boy stood by the hot glue and created layers of colorful adornments on his stick. We covered the cafeteria tables in brown paper and invited participants to use any material to create circles. After about five minutes, everyone moved over one seat to collaborate with the circle their neighbor had started. We continued this process, allowing everyone to work on each circle. The finished product was a collaborative art piece with everyone's circles intertwined. This became our anchor piece for the remainder of the week. Participants with extra time could always return to work on the circles. On the third and fourth day, participants were invited to partner with someone else and trace the outline of their body on a large piece of paper. Each person filled their tracing with an illustration of how they felt inside their body. When finished, artists were asked to tell me what they could “feel, see, and imagine.” They used words like “happy” and “colorful.” In a time of isolation and confusion, participants were dropping into art making and feeling the power of the collective community. A photograph of the community circle art piece is displayed below.",
